## Abstract

zk-vehicle-insurance addresses the pressing need to safeguard the privacy and authenticity of vehicle owner information within insurance claims. Existing vehicle insurance processes suffer from inefficiencies, complex services, unreliable data, and the looming threat of data leakage. To overcome these challenges while respecting privacy and sensitivity concerns, we harness the power of blockchain technology, smart contracts, and zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) techniques.

Our project introduces an innovative vehicle insurance claim scheme built on smart contracts, blockchain, and zero-knowledge proofs. Our primary objective is to uphold privacy during both car insurance authorization and claim processes. We have crafted two distinct types of smart contracts: a private contract for managing vehicle insurance policies and a public contract for overseeing claim authorization and validation.

By leveraging ZoKrates, we generate zero-knowledge proofs off-chain and subsequently verify them on-chain. This approach significantly reduces data storage and computational requirements on the blockchain while simultaneously ensuring robust privacy protection for sensitive information. Our empirical findings affirm the effectiveness of our scheme in terms of both security and performance.
